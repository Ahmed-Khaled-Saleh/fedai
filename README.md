Fedai enables rapid FL research and prototyping. It’s a Library of
different federated learning scenarios (iid, non-iid, …), deep learning
models (LLMs, CNNs, MLPs, …) and datasets, that is designed to make
federated learning more accessible and accelerate your research. It’s
also easily extendible so that you can bring your
algorithm/data/scneario in a few lines of code.

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.
